# Project Setup Instructions

## 1. Create a Conda Environment

To create a new conda environment with Python 3.10, run the following command:

```bash
conda create -n <env-name> python=3.10
```

Replace `<env-name>` with the desired name of your environment.

## 2. Activate the Conda Environment

Activate the newly created environment:

```bash
conda activate <env-name>
```

## 3. Install Requirements

Once inside the environment, install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

---

Now your environment is ready to go!
